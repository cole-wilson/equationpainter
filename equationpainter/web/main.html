		Welcome to EquationPainter!
		<br><br>
		EquationPainter will help you create "paint-by-equation" spreadsheets for your students. They will love it!
		All you need is an image file.
		<br><br>
		EquationPainter lets you define a list of equations in a text file, with their answer seperated with "|=>|". An example is below.
		<br><textarea rows="3" readonly style="resize:none;">
1 + 2 = |=>| 3
2 + 8 = |=>| 10
4 + 6 = |=>| 10</textarea><br><br>

		It can also generate a list of addition and/or subtraction problems for you.<br><br>

		Every question has a color mapped to it, more questions means more colors in the output drawing.
		<br><br>
